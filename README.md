# Electronics
My electronics projects. Nothing special actually.

## Why?
I created this repo to make sure my files are not lost and other makers can get
inspiration from my low-quality work.

## Structure
Each subdirectory of the repo represents a different project. They are all in
one repo, because I don't want to make a gaarbage pile from my profile.

## Projects
Descriptions of each project I made. Only one so far.

### `robot_biped1` WIP
__Bipedal robot__ with two shining eyes, a head and two legs. My first serious
project with Arduino and electronics at all.
