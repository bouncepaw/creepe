Reading Disclaimer 2018

Hi, this is bouncepaw, author of this very program.

I feel urge to inform you, my precious reader, that I like macros. They are so
cute ain't they? Well, that's why I may use them. For instance:

  times(3) { ... } // same as for(int t = 0; t < 3; t ++) { ... }

I think it's more readable. Also, you'd better know that these things are same:

  condition && func(); // same as if(condition) func();
  condition || func(); // same as if(!condition) func();

In this case readability reduces for sure, but I like how it looks with those
extremely cute operators. I call them ANDy and VictORia. So should you.

You may have a different opinion, but I don't care much. This is my code. If
you have cool ideas of how to obfuscate code even more, feel free to get in
touch with me: bouncepaw2@ya.ru.
